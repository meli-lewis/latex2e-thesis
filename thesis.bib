@article{gratton_new_1983,
	Abstract = {A new off-line procedure for dealing with ocular artifacts in {ERP} recording is described. The procedure {(EMCP)} uses {EOG} and {EEG} records for individual trials in an experimental session to estimate a propagation factor which describes the relationship between the {EOG} and {EEG} traces. The propagation factor is computed after stimulus-linked variability in both traces has been removed. Different propagation factors are computed for blinks and eye movements. Tests are presented which demonstrate the validity and reliability of the procedure. {ERPs} derived from trials corrected by {EMCP} are more similar to a 'true' {ERP} than are {ERPs} derived from either uncorrected or randomly corrected trials. The procedure also reduces the difference between {ERPs} which are based on trials with different degrees of {EOG} variance. Furthermore, variability at each time point, across trials, is reduced following correction. The propagation factor decreases from frontal to parietal electrodes, and is larger for saccades than blinks. It is more consistent within experimental sessions than between sessions. The major advantage of the procedure is that it permits retention of all trials in an {ERP} experiment, irrespective of ocular artifact. Thus, studies of populations characterized by a high degree of artifact, and those requiring eye movements as part of the experimental task, are made possible. Furthermore, there is no need to require subjects to restrict eye movement activity. In comparison to procedures suggested by others, {EMCP} also has the advantage that separate correction factors are computed for blinks and movements and that these factors are based on data from the experimental session itself rather than from a separate calibration session.},

@article{grillon_fear_1993,
	Abstract = {The startle reflex is potentiated during experimentally induced anxiety (fear-potentiated startle). It is also increased in various anxiety disorders. The present study investigated the relationship between individual differences in fear and anxiety, and startle modulation. The eyeblink component of the acoustic startle reflex was measured in a paradigm involving the anticipation of electric shocks in 22 healthy men who were volunteers. Each subject's fear of shock was assessed with the state portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory {(STAI;} Spielberger 1983). Fear-potentiated startle, but not baseline startle, differed in the low and high fear subjects. The magnitude of fear-potentiated startle was larger in the high-fear group as compared to the low-fear group. The time-course of startle modulation suggested a longer duration of anticipatory anxiety in the high-fear group. Trait anxiety, which was assessed with the trait portion of the {STAI}, did not relate to individual differences in either baseline or fear-potentiated startle.},

@article{matias-guiu_editorial_2011,
	Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}

Many authors believe that there are biases in scientific publications. Editorial biases include publication bias; which refers to those situations where the results influence the editor's decision, and editorial bias refers to those situations where factors related with authors or their environment influence the decision.


{DEVELOPMENT}

This paper includes an analysis of the situation of editorial biases. One bias is where mainly articles with positive results are accepted, as opposed to those with negative results. Another is latent bias, where positive results are published before those with negative results. In order to examine editorial bias, this paper analyses the influence of where the article originated; the country or continent, academic centre of origin, belonging to cooperative groups, and the maternal language of the authors. The article analyses biases in the editorial process in the publication of funded clinical trials.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Editorial biases exists. Authors, when submitting their manuscript, should analyse different journals and decide where their article will receive adequate treatment.},

	Abstract = {Neuroimaging and the discipline of cognitive neuroscience have grown together in lock-step with each pushing the other toward an improved ability to explore and examine brain function and form. However successful neuroimaging and the examination of cognitive processes may seem today, the culture of data sharing in these fields remains underdeveloped. In this article, we discuss our own experience in the development of the {fMRI} Data Center {(fMRIDC)} - a large-scale effort to gather, curate, and openly share the complete data sets from published research articles of brain activation studies using {fMRI.} We outline the {fMRIDC} effort's beginnings, how it operated, note some of the sociological reactions we received, and provide several examples of prominent new studies performed using data drawn from the archive. Finally, we provide comment on what considerations are needed for successful neuroimaging databasing and data sharing as existing and emerging efforts take the next steps in archiving and disseminating the field's valuable and irreplaceable data.},

	Abstract = {Reaction times and event-related potentials in correct and incorrect trials were studied in a bimanual choice reaction task. In a focused attention {(FA)} condition, the stimulus modality was constant (visual or auditory); in a divided attention {(DA)} condition, the modality was varied at random from trial to trial. Stimulus- and response-triggered averages were computed from the midline {EEG} leads. In error trials, the {ERP} amplitude was reduced in the P300 range (300-500 msec) and enhanced in the slow wave range (500-700 msec) compared to correct reaction trials. Difference plots between the {ERPs} (incorrect minus correct reaction trials) revealed a large fronto-central negativity {("NE")} and a parieto-occipital "slow wave." These components appeared larger in the response-triggered averages. We believe that they reflect two different stages of error processing. After auditory stimuli the {NE} peaked much later for {DA} than for {FA}, which supports the idea of an asymmetrical allocation of processing resources to the disadvantage of the auditory modality in our {DA} condition.},

@article{botvinick_conflict_2007,
	Abstract = {According to one influential account, the anterior cingulate cortex {(ACC)} serves to monitor for conflicts in information processing. According to another influential account, the {ACC} monitors action outcomes and guides decision making. Both of these perspectives are supported by an abundance of data, making it untenable to reject one view in favor of the other. Instead, the apparent challenge is to discover how the two perspectives might fit together within a larger account. In the present article, we consider the prospects for such a reconciliation. Juxtaposing the conflict-monitoring and decision-making accounts suggests an extension of the conflict-monitoring theory, by which conflict would act as a teaching signal driving a form of avoidance learning. The effect of this mechanism would be to bias behavioral decision making toward cognitively efficient tasks and strategies. We discuss evidence favoring this proposal and present an initial computational model, which lays the foundation for further development.},

	Abstract = {A fully fledged neuroscience of personality is beginning to emerge, shaped and guided in large measure by the seminal work of Jeffrey A. Gray over a period of 40 years. In this Festschrift, I trace the theoretical development of Gray's approach--now known as Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory {(RST)--out} of the Eysenckian tradition to its most recent articulation. Experimental attempts to test {RST} are reviewed and the theoretical problems raised by this literature discussed. Also presented are data relating to a recent clarification of {RST}, viz. the joint subsystems hypothesis, which postulates a fundamental interdependence of appetitive and aversive systems in the typical human laboratory. The value of Gray's general approach to building behavioural theories on the bases of both the conceptual nervous system and the real nervous system is validated in personality, which has long been thought a philosophical mystery rather than a standard problem to be tackled by scientific method.},

@article{nieuwenhuis_error_2001,
	Abstract = {The error negativity {(Ne/ERN)} and error positivity {(Pe)} are two components of the event-related brain potential {(ERP)} that are associated with action monitoring and error detection. To investigate the relation between error processing and conscious self-monitoring of behavior, the present experiment examined whether an Ne and Pe are observed after response errors of which participants are unaware. Ne and Pe measures, behavioral accuracy, and trial-to-trial subjective accuracy judgments were obtained from participants performing an antisaccade task, which elicits many unperceived, incorrect reflex-like saccades. Consistent with previous research, subjectively unperceived saccade errors were almost always immediately corrected, and were associated with faster correction times and smaller saccade sizes than perceived errors. Importantly, irrespective of whether the participant was aware of the error or not, erroneous saccades were followed by a sizable Ne. In contrast, the Pe was much more pronounced for perceived than for unperceived errors. Unperceived errors were characterized by the absence of posterror slowing. These and other results are consistent with the view that the Ne and Pe reflect the activity of two separate error monitoring processes, of which only the later process, reflected by the Pe, is associated with conscious error recognition and remedial action.},

@book{nielsen_reinventing_2012,
	Abstract = {{"In} Reinventing Discovery, Michael Nielsen argues that we are living at the dawn of the most dramatic change in science in more than 300 years. This change is being driven by powerful new cognitive tools, enabled by the internet, which are greatly accelerating scientific discovery. There are many books about how the internet is changing business or the workplace or government. But this is the first book about something much more fundamental: how the internet is transforming the nature of our collective intelligence and how we understand the world. Reinventing Discovery tells the exciting story of an unprecedented new era of networked science. We learn, for example, how mathematicians in the Polymath Project are spontaneously coming together to collaborate online, tackling and rapidly demolishing previously unsolved problems. We learn how 250,000 amateur astronomers are working together in a project called Galaxy Zoo to understand the large-scale structure of the Universe, and how they are making astonishing discoveries, including an entirely new kind of galaxy. These efforts are just a small part of the larger story told in this book--the story of how scientists are using the internet to dramatically expand our problem-solving ability and increase our combined brainpower. This is a book for anyone who wants to understand how the online world is revolutionizing scientific discovery today--and why the revolution is just beginning"-- {"Reinventing} Discovery argues that we are in the early days of the most dramatic change in how science is done in more than 300 years. This change is being driven by new online tools, which are transforming and radically accelerating scientific discovery"--},

	Abstract = {The error-related negativity {(ERN)} is a negative deflection in the event-related potential that is maximal approximately 50 ms after the commission of an error. The {ERN} is generated in the anterior cingulate cortex, a region of the medial prefrontal cortex implicated in both cognitive and emotional processing. Affective and motivational variables influence the magnitude of the {ERN}, which suggests that the {ERN} may relate to emotional or motivational aspects of error detection. In the present study, we evaluated the possibility that errors prime defensive motivational responses, and that the {ERN} may predict the magnitude of defensive reactivity after errors. We found that (a) the defensive startle response was larger following errors than following correct responses, and (b) the magnitude of the {ERN} predicted the degree of startle potentiation following errors. Thus, response errors prime defensive motivation-and the {ERN} predicts individual differences in the aversive response to errors.},
