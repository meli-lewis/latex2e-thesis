\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Mean event-related potentials time-locked to correct and erroneous responses at electrode FCz (left). This graph plots voltage over time, where the response occurs at 0 milliseconds (ms). The error-related negativity (ERN) is observed as a sharp negative deflection that peaks around 50 ms (illustrated by the gray bar) after the commission of a mistake.The voltage difference between errors and correct responses in the time window of the ERN can be plotted over the scalp (right); the ERN is maximal at the frontal-central midline of the scalp.
