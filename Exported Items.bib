	abstract = {Reaction times and event-related potentials in correct and incorrect trials were studied in a bimanual choice reaction task. In a focused attention {(FA)} condition, the stimulus modality was constant (visual or auditory); in a divided attention {(DA)} condition, the modality was varied at random from trial to trial. Stimulus- and response-triggered averages were computed from the midline {EEG} leads. In error trials, the {ERP} amplitude was reduced in the P300 range (300-500 msec) and enhanced in the slow wave range (500-700 msec) compared to correct reaction trials. Difference plots between the {ERPs} (incorrect minus correct reaction trials) revealed a large fronto-central negativity {("NE")} and a parieto-occipital "slow wave." These components appeared larger in the response-triggered averages. We believe that they reflect two different stages of error processing. After auditory stimuli the {NE} peaked much later for {DA} than for {FA}, which supports the idea of an asymmetrical allocation of processing resources to the disadvantage of the auditory modality in our {DA} condition.},
